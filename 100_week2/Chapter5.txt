5.2.4 Exercises
Find all flights that:

Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
> hours <- 60
> filter(flights, arr_delay > (2 * hours))

Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
> filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))

Were operated by United, American, or Delta
> filter(flights, carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))

Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
> filter(flights, month >= 7 & month <= 9)

Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
> hours <- 60
> filter(flights, ((arr_delay > 2 * hours) & (dep_delay <= 0)))

Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
> minutes <- 1
> filter(flights, ((dep_delay >= 1 * hours) & ((dep_delay - arr_delay) > 30 * minutes)))

Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
> filter(flights, dep_time >= 0000 & dep_time <= 0600)

Another useful dplyr filtering helper is between(). What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?
> filter(flights, between(month, 7, 9))
> filter(flights, between(dep_time, 0000, 0600))

How many flights have a missing dep_time?
8255

What other variables are missing?
dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay, tailnum

What might these rows represent?
Canceled flights?

Why is NA ^ 0 not missing?
So, the reason that any number to the zero power is one is because any number to the zero power is just the product of no numbers at all, which is the multiplicative identity, 1. REF: http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=2626

Why is NA | TRUE not missing?
Because "or" continues evaluation until it finds a true expression

Why is FALSE & NA not missing?
Because NA is falsey?

Can you figure out the general rule? (NA * 0 is a tricky counterexample!)
Arithmetic of NA is NA, evaluation of NA is ignored?
